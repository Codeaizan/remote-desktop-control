### Components

1. **Desktop Client** - Python application that captures screen and receives control commands
2. **Railway Server** - Node.js/Flask server handling WebSocket connections and routing
3. **Web Viewer** - Browser-based interface for viewing and controlling the remote screen

## ⚙️ Configuration

Edit these values in `desktop_client.py` to customize performance:

Screen resolution (lower = faster)
SCREEN_WIDTH = 854 # Options: 640, 854, 1280, 1920
SCREEN_HEIGHT = 480 # Options: 360, 480, 720, 1080

JPEG quality (lower = faster, higher = clearer)
JPEG_QUALITY = 35 # Range: 20-95

Frames per second (higher = smoother)
FPS = 45 # Options: 15, 24, 30, 45, 60


## 🛡️ Security Features

- ✅ Unique room IDs for each session
- ✅ Dangerous system keys blocked (Ctrl, Alt, Win)
- ✅ No persistent connections or data storage
- ✅ HTTPS encryption (via Railway)
- ✅ Temporary sessions (auto-cleanup on disconnect)

## 🔧 Performance Tips

### For Faster Performance

SCREEN_WIDTH = 640
SCREEN_HEIGHT = 360
JPEG_QUALITY = 30
FPS = 60

### For Better Quality

SCREEN_WIDTH = 1920
SCREEN_HEIGHT = 1080
JPEG_QUALITY = 80
FPS = 24


### Balanced (Recommended)

SCREEN_WIDTH = 1280
SCREEN_HEIGHT = 720
JPEG_QUALITY = 50
FPS = 30
